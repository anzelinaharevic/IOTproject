Project Description 

In Census 2022, there were 425,974 people living alone in Ireland. Many of us have elder parents or grandparents who are adamant on living alone as they would like to keep their independence. 
My project proposal is a smart home care device that allows them to stay safe and reassures the family.  

I would have a motion sensor note when there was movement last detected and notify their emergency contact via text message if none detected for a long period of time.
A ESP-Eye used for voice recognition if they ever needed help and a camera. The button would be worn by them and in an emergency situation pressing it would send out a SMS message and call 999.
This can be deactivated using a keypad. They would have temperature sensors which would be displayed on an LCD display.  
The coding languages that will be integrated into the system include CSS, html and JavaScript for the web site and C++ used for the ESP-32.  
This would greatly reduce mortality rate for people who are vulnerable living alone. I aim to make this be a cost-efficient solution as vulnerable and elder people spend enough on healthcare as it is.
